## About
FlyXpert is an academic project built for the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) course.  
This desktop application implements a flight booking system that allows users to:  
- Sign up / Sign in  
- Search and filter flights  
- Book flights for themselves and/or other passengers  
- Choose seats for each passenger  
- Pay using preferred payment method  
- Manage their bookings  

In addition, administrators have a special interface which lets them:  
- Add new flights  
- Edit existing flight details  
- Delete flights  

This project was designed and implemented by Tamana & Anwesha to demonstrate mastery of OOP principles, GUI design, and desktop app development.
